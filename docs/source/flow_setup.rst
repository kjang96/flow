Setup Instructions
******************

To get Flow running, you need three things: Flow,
SUMO, and rllab. Once each component is installed successfully,
you might get some missing module bugs from Python. Just install the
missing module using your OS-specific package manager / installation
tool. Follow the shell commands below to get started.

Dependencies
============
We begin by installing dependencies needed by the four repositories mentioned
above.
It will be useful to install `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ for Python and enable it right away.
For Ubuntu 16.04:
::

    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
    sudo apt-get install cmake swig libgtest-dev python-pygame python-scipy autoconf libtool pkg-config libgdal-dev libxerces-c-dev libproj-dev libfox-1.6-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev build-essential curl unzip flex bison python python-dev python3-dev
    sudo pip3 install cmake cython

For OSX:
::

    # rllab dependencies
    brew install swig sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi
    # sumo dependencies
    brew install Caskroom/cask/xquartz autoconf automake pkg-config libtool gdal proj xerces-c fox

sumo
====
Next, we install SUMO, an open source traffic microsimulator which will be used
the update the states of vehicles, traffic lights, and other RL and
human-driven agents during the simulation process.
::

    cd ~
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse/sumo
    cd sumo
    git fetch origin refs/replace/*:refs/replace/*
    make -f Makefile.cvs
    ./configure
    make
    echo 'export SUMO_HOME="$HOME/sumo"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/sumo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/sumo/tools:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

rllab-multiagent
================
Flow has been tested on a variety of RL libraries, the installation of which is
optional but may be of use when trying to execute some of the examples files
located in Flow. In order to install the `rllab-multiagent` library, follow the
below instructions
::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/cathywu/rllab-multiagent.git
    cd rllab-multiagent
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    python3 setup.py develop
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/rllab-multiagent:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    ## flow
    ```shell
    cd ~/rllab-multiagent # Repo flow needs to be installed within rllab-multiagent.
    git clone https://github.com/berkeleyflow/flow.git
    cd flow
    python3 setup.py develop
    echo 'export PYTHONPATH="$HOME/rllab-multiagent/flow:$PYTHONPATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc

Ray/RLlib
=========
RLlib is the second RL library that has been extensively tested on the Flow
repository. The installation process for this library is as follows:
::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/ray.git
    pushd ray/python
    sudo python3 setup.py develop
    popd

If missing libraries cause errors, please also install the required libraries as specified at <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html> and then follow the setup instructions.

Testing the Installation
========================

Once the above modules have been successfully installed, we can test the
installation by running a few examples.

To run any of the RL examples, make sure to run
::

    source activate flow
    
Running the following should result in the loading of the SUMO GUI.
Click the run button and you should see unstable traffic form after a
few seconds, a la (Sugiyama et al, 2008).

Run the unit tests:
::

    nose2 -s tests/fast_tests

Letâ€™s see some traffic action:
::

    python examples/sumo/sugiyama.py

This means that you have Flow properly configured with SUMO.
::

    python examples/rllib/stabilizing_the_ring.py

This means that you have Flow properly configured with both SUMO and
rllib. Congratulations, you now have Flow set up!


Getting started (Ray/RLlib)
===========================

See `getting started with RLlib <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rllib.html#getting-started>`_ for sample commands.

To visualize the training progress:
::

    tensorboard --logdir=~/ray_results

For information on how to deploy a cluster, refer to the `Ray instructions <http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoscaling.html>`_.
The basic workflow is running the following locally, ssh-ing into the host machine, and starting
jobs from there.

::

    ray create_or_update scripts/ray_autoscale.yaml
    ray teardown scripts/ray_autoscale.yaml


Custom configuration
====================

You may define user-specific config parameters as follows
::

    cp flow/core/config.template.py flow/core/config.py  # Create template for users using pycharm
